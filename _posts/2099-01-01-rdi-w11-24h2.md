## Rational Developer for i 9.8 and Windows 11 Version 24H2

Many users had problems using RDi 9.8 after they updated their workstation to Windows 11 Version 24H2. Also other Java based applications have problems - especlially if SentinelOne security software is installed and active.

Here some tips, that might help - even as it seems, that right now, there is no universal solution.

### Updating to RDi 9.8.0.4

If your RDi is at least running, you can try to install the latest fix pack 9.8.0.4. This fix pack contains a new IBM Java runtime., and this might help.

### Installing an alternative Java runtime

Using an alternative Java runtime seems to be a good solution. Some users had good results with Amazons Corretto Java runtime,

- https://aws.amazon.com/de/corretto

Here the direct download download link:

- [Amazon Corretto OpenJDK Version 21](https://corretto.aws/downloads/latest/amazon-corretto-21-x64-windows-jdk.msi)

After installing the new runtime, you have to configure RDi to use it, instead of its own JRE. Before you do this, you should make a backup copy of the file `RDi.ini` in the RDi installation directory.

Now open the file `RDi.ini` with your preffered text editor.

Find the line after `-vm` - here you find the path of the JRE, that RDi should use. Replace the path (normally starting with `plugins/com.ibm.semeru`) with the path to the `JAVAW.EXE` of your newly installed JDK - normally that would be:
```
C:/Program Files/Amazon Corretto/jdk21.0.6_7/bin/javaw.exe
```
Of course your path can vary because of another JDK version.
