## IBM Champion 2025

To my surprise, I was selected to be an IBM Champion 2025.

Well - somehow surprised - late last year, as I was nominated by the great Birgitta Hauser. 
And after reviewing my advocacy and community activities of 2024, I thought to give it a try.

And a month ago, I was contacted by the IBM Champions team around Libby Ingrassia, to complete
some forms and my IBM profile.

And now - here I am.
