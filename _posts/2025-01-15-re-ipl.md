## Blog Re-IPL

After 6 years of using hosted WordPress I thought its about time, to change something. And as I'm a big fan of MarkDown and Git, I wanted to make use of this, for my blog. 

Thanks to [Chad Baldwin](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) and the good people at [Github](https://pages.github.com), I was able to create a setup, that really fits my needs and is so simply, that is doesn't get in the way.

I will re-post many of my old blog posts here again - I just need some time, to convert the WordPress posts to MarkDown. 
And I will try to update / re-write the posts where possible and necessary.
Where necessary I will translate old posts from German to English, as this is the main language for the blog now. 

So every blog post with a date older than this one, is essentially a re-post from the old blog. 
To save you from reading old posts again and again, I will add **\*UPDATED** to the headline of 
every old post, that has some new information and therefore may be worth re-reading.

Thanks for your interest.
