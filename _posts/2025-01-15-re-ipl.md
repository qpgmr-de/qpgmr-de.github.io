## Blog Re-IPL

After 6 years of using hosted WordPress I thought its about time, to change something. And as I'm a big fan of MarkDown and Git, I wanted to make use of this, for my blog. 

Thanks to [Chad Baldwin](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) and the good people at [Github](https://pages.github.com), I was able to create a setup, that really fits my needs.

I will re-post many of my old blog posts here again - I just need some time, to convert the WordPress posts to MarkDown. And I will try to update the posts where possible and necessary.

Thanks for your interest.
