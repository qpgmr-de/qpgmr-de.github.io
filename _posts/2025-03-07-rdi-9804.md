This process will update your RDi instance to the latest available fix pack. And it will also update installed plugins.

#### Method #2

If method #1 (aka Check for Updates) doesn't not work for you - whatever the reason is - you can try, to install the new fix pack by selecting „Install new software…“ in the „Help“ menu. Then select the preconfigured RDi update site from the pull down list:

Select the new fix pack 9.8.0.4 and click the „Next >“ button and follow the instructions.

If you still also problems updating with this method, try to uncheck the box "Contact all update sites during install to find required sofware" and try again.

#### Timeout errors during updates

If you received a timeout error while RDi is downloading the packages, simply repeat the process and try again. Packages that were already downloaded are not downloaded again.
