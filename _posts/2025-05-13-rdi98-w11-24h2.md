## Rational Developer for i 9.8 vs Windows 11 Version 24H2

Since Microsoft rolled out Windows 11 version 24H2 many users had massive problems using RDi 9.8 after the update. Other Java based applications - like IBM i Access Client Solutions (iACS) make problems, too.

The reason seems to be connected to cyber security package [SentinelOne](https://sentinelone.com) - since users that don't use that software mostly have no problems.

Until now, I don't know of a fix for Windows, RDi oder SentinelOne that permanently works - but here are some tips, that might help.

### The problem

Even if RDi or iACS seem to run, they crash without a warning after an undefined runtime. On some machines RDi doesn't start at all.

### Updating to RDi 9.8.0.4

If possible, you should definitly upgrade to the latest RDi version 9.8.0.4 before you start the upgrade to Windows 11 24H2.

### White-listing RDi.exe in SentinelOne

It seems, that simply white-listing the file `RDi.exe` on your machine in SentinelOne helps, and RDi doesn't crash anymore. But this doesn't help with other Java based applications like iACS. You would have to white-list all of them, which might be inconvinient.

### Installing an alternative Java runtime

Using an alternative Java runtime seems to work too - and I achieved good results with Amazons Corretto Java,

- https://aws.amazon.com/de/corretto

  [Amazon Corretto OpenJDK Version 21](https://corretto.aws/downloads/latest/amazon-corretto-21-x64-windows-jdk.msi)

After installing the new runtime, you have to configure RDi to use it, instead of its own JRE. Before you do this, you should make a backup copy of the file `RDi.ini` in the RDi installation directory.

Now open the file `RDi.ini` with your preffered text editor.

Find the line after `-vm` - here you find the path of the JRE, that RDi should use. Replace the path (normally starting with `plugins/com.ibm.semeru`) with the path to the `JAVAW.EXE` of your newly installed JDK - e.g. that might be:
```
C:\Program Files\Amazon Corretto\jdk21.0.6_7\bin\javaw
```
Of course your path can vary because of another JDK version.

You also have to remove the line reading `-vmargs`.

After that, a double click on `RDi.exe` should start RDi and it should work.

### Known problems

1. Whenever your Amazon Corretto JDK is updated, it's installed in new directory with the current version number. So you will have to change the VM path in `RDi.ini` after every JDK update.
2. With every update of RDi the `RDi.ini` is overwritten - so you will have to make the changes every time again.
3. In RDi the LPEX editor sometimes signals syntax errors in RPGLE code, that are in fact no errors. E.g. LPEX will signal an syntax error for a variable name like `#something` - but the RPGLE compiler accepts this variable name.
