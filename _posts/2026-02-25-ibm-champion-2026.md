## IBM Champion 2026

My first year as an IBM Champion was very cool. The parcel with the IBM Champion gifts, 
attending IBM TechXchange in Orlando, Fl together with my daughter, meeting great people,
learning new things and teaching what I know to others.

And after meticulously reporting all my "Champions Activities", I was not SOOO surprised
this year, that I was selected to be an IBM Champion again for 2026.

So now again - I'm and IBM Champion for 2026, and will try make the best out of this year.
